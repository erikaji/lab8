    <h3>Deciding User Interaction Flow</h3>

      <p><center>
        First, our team thought through our ideas and decided to go with our "Rose, Bud, Thorn" concept.<br />
        (We later realized that collaborative storyboarding wasn't so far off from Google Slides anyhow!)
      </center></p>

        After deciding to go with our "Rose, Bud, Thorn" concept, we brainstormed alternative names<br />
        that would be friendlier to all genders. We used these names as a jumping-off point for user interface ideas.

      <p><center>
        We thought through the key functionality pieces that we would want to distinguish in our two prototypes,<br />
        and we also considered what kind of people to invite to give feedback on our presentation.
      </center></p>

        After drawing through many different ideas, we settled on two prototype ideas.<br />
        Each would show a different way to 1) view and 2) upload one's "RBT."
