    <h3>Implementation Changes</h3>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Based on our <a href="7">use study results</a>, we implemented the following changes in our final application:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Sunshine interaction</b> - users described wanting to be able to respond to what their friends wrote, but in a very different way from competing for the most number of likes received on Facebook. To match our Rose Bud thorn theme, we chose the action of <i>giving sunshine</i> as a way for users to respond to their friends' roses, buds, and thorns. In addition, to remove the competitive element, we made sunshines <i>visible only to the giver and the recipient</i>.</li>
        <li><b>Welcome and help text</b> - many users do not know what Rose Bud Thorn is. We created a welcome screen to introduce the concept of Rose Bud Thorn, and we also placed help text on the upload page to refresh users' understanding of the exercise.</li>
        <li><b>User login</b> - we completed the backend system allowing for multiple users to update the database, including two dummy accounts for testing. For now, to preserve the small-group feel of the application without introducing a group system (out of scope for our current project), we have not implemented a way to create new accounts and add groups.</li>
        <li><b>General UI/UX</b> - we made general aesthetic improvements and fixed some navigation bar problems.</li>
      </ul>
