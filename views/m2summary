      <p><center>
        To come up with ideas for our three storyboards, we started off with the two needs/ideas that we found most compelling from our M1.<br />
        We brainstormed for 25 minutes on both of them at the same time.

        Just as we did for our M1 brainstorms, we tagged our favorite ideas and consolidated similar ideas to find our main storyboard ideas.
