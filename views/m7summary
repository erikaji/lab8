    <h3>Use Study Goals</h3>
    <div class="section">
      <p>We designed our use study to investigate both performance data (direct observation of user performing key tasks) and perceptual data (user's thoughts spoken aloud and answers to open-ended questions) surrounding the user experience for three core tasks:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>viewing friends' Rose Bud Thorns (including filtering),</li>
        <li>viewing one's own Rose Bud Thorn, and </li>
        <li>updating one's own Rose Bud Thorn (including photo upload).</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Furthermore, we wanted our use study to answer whether or not users wanted to see Rose Bud Thorn history in the app.</p>

            <br />5 users had prior experience doing a Rose Bud Thorn exercise or similar exercise in one of two different in-person group environments.
            <br />4 users did not have prior experience with the Rose Bud Thorn concept.</li>
