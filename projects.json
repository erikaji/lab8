			"summary": "<p>As Yogi Berra said, you can observe a lot just by watching. Watching how people do things is a great way to learn their goals and values, and come up with design insight. We call this <b>needfinding</b>. This assignment helps you train your eyes and ears to come up with design ideas. Your goal is to uncover user needs, breakdowns, clever hacks, and opportunities for improvement.</p>",

			"summary": "<p>This is the first team assignment. Review and share the user needs you brainstormed. This week, you'll flesh out your design ideas by creating a point of view, seeking inspiration, storyboarding, and making paper prototypes. These are the blueprints for the mobile web application you'll make.</p>",

			"summary": "<p>As Carolyn Snyder writes, 'Paper prototyping is a variation of usability testing where the representative users perform realistic tasks by interacting with a paper version of the interface that is manipulated by a person 'playing computer' who doesn't explain how the interface is intended to work.' In this assignment, your group will conduct heuristic evaluations (HEs) of your paper prototypes and you will individually help out other groups by evaluating theirs. This will complete the prototyping phase of the project, providing you with the feedback you need to begin implementing.</p>",

			"title": "User Study",
			"summary": "<p>Review the feedback you got last week from the Heuristic Evaluations of your prototypes. Distill the HE results into a list of concrete changes you want to make to your prototype. Use what worked, and improve what didn't. If you haven't already, make a decision about the prototype you are going with. This could be one of the two you tested or a combination of them. Again, take the time you need. This is what you will be working on for the rest of the course, so make sure you will feel invested in it.</p>",

Also, update your development plan as you discover more about what you want to prioritize, what you can expect to implement, and what you may need to mock up. The goal is for you to complete the interaction flow this week.</p>",
